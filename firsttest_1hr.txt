okay just your interactions
and
uh say in the consent form did you also
include your email address
no okay but you have everything yeah
yeah
because i need that to
send you the amazon
okay so i'm gonna go over everything
that you guys need to do
um
for our experiment you two will be
interacting with
with artie
a virtual assistant who is always
listening and he will be making
visualizations for you
say hi to artie hello
hello
um
so you two will be
exploring kobe 19 data set
in order to try answer a list of
questions with the help of party
throughout this process feel free to
discuss things between the three of you
your task is to make visualizations
visualization
three of you commit youtube and
okay
your task is to make visualizations that
will help you build up evidence
to support your answer to the questions
on the paper
i'm going to explain all the tools that
are available to you
so
rda will be listening to you from these
three microphones one two three
just keep that in mind in case you find
already has difficulty viewing you
in front of you is a touch screen
display
and this window
there's a list of attributes that are in
the data set go ahead and google
so in front of you is a sorry they only
have one touch pin
another person will need to use that
sharpie is the touchpad
um
yeah you can
click on those drag the window around
from the title bar oh yeah
so
use your finger too but it's not very
precise that's why we
had to use a little stick instead yeah
okay
so
again this window has a list of
attributes that are in the data set
you can tap on any of those attributes
and you can see a list of unique data
values that you can use to help you
narrow down the visualizations you want
to produce
for example you can make a chart related
to
high diabetes rate and high
cardiovascular
disease rate
um
any questions about the tools
so we just need to answer these five
questions
um yeah i can
i'm gonna go over
uh how to use this system
so when you want to create a
visualization you can tell already the
visualizations you want to make you've
already understand you will respond with
the voice bubble as you saw earlier
article
will make will appear on this blue row
on the bottom
new visual new visualizations will
appear on the right
and as this role fills up
visualizations will be pushed to the
left
once the visualizations are pushed off
the screen
it will disappear forever
so if you do see a visualization that
you think will help you with your task
you can tap on the visualizations
and they will appear in this large white
space
provided above
the visualizations will appear as a
in a window just like the attribute list
[Music]
so once the visualizations are in the
white space
you can drag them around with your
finger or the touch pen or the sharpie
you can delete the visualizations by
tapping on them
um
by tapping on the red x button on the
top left of the window
you can resize visual visualizations by
dragging the bottom right corner you're
going to have one just like that
you can also select visualizations by
tapping on them
and the title bar will turn until color
if you tap on them again
you will unselect the visualization
so when visualizations are selected you
can tell already to
modify the visualizations
to either replace filters attributes
or change the type of chart
um so keep in mind the touch wall is
very sensitive so as you're dragging
visualizations around you might actually
um select them
so
yeah
already can make bar charts
line charts
heat maps and maps
but you don't have to explicitly ask for
those type of charts
already will try to make the best
type of chart to answer your question
so again you should go through each of
the tasks explore the data
and when you're ready
you can present
your answer to me by referring to the
charts that best answer the question in
a task
any
questions so how do we instruct it to
make official decisions
okay so you can tell already um
like just think of party just like any
other human
being so if you want to ask somebody to
make a chart for you what would you say
um
you make a line shot
oh yeah he's he's not um he's not
starting yet
i guess we'll ask more questions as it
goes on if anything
um yeah that's fine
okay
yeah i mean we we are we're not going to
give you too many tips we just want you
to try and treat arnie
as your facilitator
to make visualizations so you won't
actually be pushing buttons to make
visualizations
you're going to be asking for rd's help
to make those virtualizations
oh
make us a map
already make a map of the united states
up
a little bit bigger also
access the doctor
should we scroll this down
uh
uh can we see a chart for kobe the risk
oh no what kind of choice you wanted oh
make a chart for a covered risk
high problems oh wait
number of
is
that's your country
um
can we do the
one thing i wanted to let you keep in
mind is that
the more you talk to each other
loud enough so that arty can hear
already can help you to make
visualizations
so party is trying to unders hear you
and understand you so
so treat him like somebody in the room
as three of you right now you're
ignoring arden
exactly now try to include him in the
conversation
discussed
that's different
wait what kind of challenges arty can
you make a map of counties
can you filter the histogram by county
types
just like comments
can we see a chart of population by
county
there you go
already filter the map by area type
can you filter the map by area type
are you not working
party hello
can you make a map for all counties
um
arie can you make a heat map for uh
counties versus
this is diabetes helping us yet
this one i don't think it's gonna help
us
oh yes
do you want to make the keyboard
already make a heat map of
cobit risk versus region
already make a heat heat map chart of
oven risk versus region
i'll probably just flipped it
just take this one
well this is
a resource
resources
it's pretty high in the midwest well
very high in the southeast
um
can you make a heat a heat map chart of
that
of cobit risk versus region
okay
[Music]
[Music]
uh line charts bar charts maps
can you make a visualization
for mapping midwest rural and high
poverty rates
oh that's cool
access to the doctor so tonight
that is just one attribute
but you can see here it's actually very
low access is very high
so it's in the middle of the west or the
midwest is very high but if we look at
the south east
york's have really high diabetes
so you want to make a selfie
chart to check up on that
you can see that
well i actually want to do the heat map
chart of
um
see it makes sense that diabetes is low
in the midwest because it accesses the
doctor
okay it's interesting
it's also little axes but very well
actually
meditation markets
the doctor
already making heat map chart of poverty
versus access to doctors filtered by
southeast and high poverty rate
can you make a heat map chart of poverty
versus access to doctors filtered by
southeast
and high poverty rates
exactly
no not
i think it's supposed to go right that
side or is it yeah it's these ones these
really small ones yes
you want to say it again
so say it again
make a heat map chart of poverty versus
access to doctors filtered by south east
it's just making really small ones so
let me do this one then
party make a heat map between access to
doctors and poverty
alrighty make a heat map between access
to doctors and poverty
make a heat map of access to doctors
versus poverty
can
filter this map by
region
already filtered his map by region
uh
[Music]
but
um
there's a keyword he's missing before
quite a different way of saying
can you check this map by region
uh search this map by region
search this map by region
already select all the regions in this
map
hmm okay i want to customize stuff
that's a look at me already change the
color scheme to
blue want to make another map instead
um i think it's nice to know
that
it's also very high on the southeast
also
access the doctors and so i'm going to
put these
already make a map of poverty versus
region
it's not the same one
well because this is just it's just this
one it's just a map of holiday so it
doesn't difficult
alrighty make a map of
region versus elderly population
what's your final present
what is that it's just about this too
did we say those things
it didn't stick oh
does it only specifically choose these
areas
okay
um
um
possible
because it is the southeast of us
already make a map of southwest plus
suburban plus high elderly population
plus very low access to doctors
may be a little too big
what if we just keeps speaking up and
then he'll just be making charts for us
that's true
okay i would like to get a map of the
midwest plus rural plus very high
poverty rate
no
can you make a map of the south west and
suburban versus hype
elderly population
thank you
can we add attributes to this
like
to specifically filter
yes
like let's say
oh thank you
that's just a doctor feels myself
an elderly percentage
there's something going on again
oh yeah two minutes
the lowest
high rates
hits the grounds
thank you
so look at the solid keys
seems very
um
can you make a heat map of covid risk
this is what we need this is the sauce
it's gonna give us everything
just perfect because we need everything
let's take a look at
access to doctors
no i actually wanted to cook
a little bit more you don't need this
one
yes no access to doctors no
very low coverage my skin
counts
doctors
but it's also interesting to see because
i think the correlation is there's
higher doctors and high risk as a
population as well
the midwest have
very little access to that dudes
but at the same time
um
you make a heat map of a heat map chart
of covered risk versus region
okay
can you make a heat map of covered risk
versus region
can you make a heat map of covered risk
versus access to doctors
can you make a heat map chart of cold
reverse versus access to doctors
interesting
can you make a chart of kovid risk
versus region
okay let's just do chart generalized
chart and then maybe it'll give us all
of them okay yep chart of covered risk
versus region
can you make a chart of cobin first
versus region
let's try it if it says they can't find
it
sometimes it means you might already
have the chart on the wall
okay
yep
so that's a bug on our part so you're
helping us find the bugs that's okay
perfect
i mean that's part of the video
um a little less
high poverty rating
i'm going to do something with
cardiovascular disease
you want to mess around with that
yeah now we have to answer all of this
why would we put all of this in one shot
is that possible
it's already okay i'll test three other
time okay
can you make us a chart of coded risk
poverty and
so diabetes just made a lot of diabetes
can you create a chart of co-adverse
poverties and diabetes per county
so he does a png i guess you didn't
understand
can you make a bar chart of covert risk
poverty and diabetes per county
diabetes
it seems like very high culvert index is
definitely in the central and then
the southeast
which is also funny because you have
lack of that in the southeast it seems
like it's very sporadic well it's kind
of just generalized
same thing with poverty it's interesting
that coded risk is very high mixed with
the property
i can kind of relay these months to each
other
can you combine two maps
i like to combine the terminals
like map of poverty and clitoris
can we just make a map of this too or we
can just give us a heat chart
can we make a map of poverty and covert
risks
can you make a map of poverty versus
coded risk
can you make a chart of poverty versus
covetours
perfect
it's just a histogram
can we change stuff too
we saw how to get to the filter
can you change this to a heat now
okay can you make this into a heat map
so far he's only creating stuff
so
and we still haven't yet figured out the
filter
what else can you do can you flip the x
and y axis
alrighty can you flip the x and y axis
for this try
interesting
i can definitely see this is like kind
of the creation of like jarvis or
something
that's some iron man stuff
it's kind of
do we need links to answer questions
i think we just wanted to look into that
i don't see a cultural correlation
although it is
um
lack of access by the middle east
it's for the middle east or the middle
sorry the midwest
doesn't seem like it has anything that
we need to worry about
is there anything called resources
do i have two
can you make a map of
covid risk by cases
can you make a map of social
vulnerability by region
just
yeah i wanted to
go
can you zoom in on this map
party
the best thing we can do is just
actually manually zoom in but
it's not kind of weird
make a heat map of covered risk versus
area type
look at yeah
i don't know if the advice area type
already make a
map of covet risk versus area type
can you make a heat map of aries
oh okay
common wrist filter partner
oh it doesn't always filter
can you make a map of covert risk
filtered by area type
that looks like the same
artie can you make a heat map
chart of
colvin risk versus area type
no all we have right now are we just
seeing that charts and regions you don't
have area types yet
i don't think they have anything on area
types
if we are making officialization
already make a heat
uh make a heat map of cardiovascular
disease
per region
okay so it is working
um
i guess we should just go down the line
we already know your coffee shorts howdy
can you make a heat map of
cardiovascular disease per region
alrighty can you make a cardiovascular
disease map
per area type
oops
dinosaur no
yeah
maybe heat map or this
heat map chart
should we travel
yes
why would you need a line charger that's
what i'm saying we don't really need
well there is a date attribute but
there's nothing
so we know that we can also check the
uninsured but that also comes with
poverty so i think it's a it's relevant
too much
right and try that let's try you still
want me to make a map of it
already making a map of the uninsured
see it's still kind of the same food
itself to south beach
it makes sense that it's not going to be
insured under
the west coast
so we know that these works
do we try cases
again
because i tried individualist plus world
plus high population high poverty rate
uh
can you make a map of diabetes versus
cardiovascular disease versus elderly
population
versus
is any
a keyword
because i want you to combine them
maybe it's because we're dealing with
three different things
i can't do that in departure
can you make a bar chart of diabetes
versus cardiovascular disease and
elderly population
no for the meantime i think
okay
i for the meantime i don't think we can
combine
data types but we can combine
them with area types
so i guess that's why
see these are four different data types
that's why it's working
it's a bar graph yeah
make a bar chart of south east plus
rural plus very high poverty rate
he keeps giving us access to targets
but it actually did the whole thing
or at least a four
filter one yeah which we wanted
with the wrong thing
oh okay
oh jesus versus states
oh
for the meantime it doesn't seem like it
would be useful for these questions at
the very least
um that's cool
thank you
i kind of want this one okay
it's for bluebees
do you think
he felt it was by mad too
what is this in high poverty rate and
very high
can you show the filters
okay
he's stuck on that one for some reason
can you remove the filters
no
can you take off a high poverty rate
filter
can you remove the null values
okay
i don't so maybe you can't do specific
parts
me too um
but you already consider some
correlations of
which regions
um
we can look at
because right now if we just look at
these two maps right here
we've already noticed that there's a
very high property mixed with the high
risk
which is an obvious correlation
and we can't mix these together
for the meantime
you can mix poverty and cover this
perfect
yeah
make a heat map chart of poverty and
coveted risk
make a heat map of poverty versus coping
risk
make a map between poverty and covert
risks
just
can you make a map between poverty and
covet risks
hello
wait do we have a bathroom
no we don't why are they all accessible
wait what's behind us
access to doctors
oh
i wish we could put them together
maybe we could do
uh
make a map of poverty filtered by high
covered risk
make a map of poverty versus
a very high coveted risk index
interesting interesting interesting
make a map of poverty filtered by region
make a map of poverty filtered by region
i think we can already answer
most of it
can you make a map of regions
can you make a map of regions
okay
i know
anything you have a map allegiance no we
do we do can you make a map by regions
can you make a map by area type
it was working earlier
do you remember what he said
make a map by area type
can you make a chart of suburban areas
this is suburban though not urgent
make a histogram a region filtered by
urban
he really loves giving us access to
dolphins
very high correlation of suburban to
urban very high correlation to the south
east also having high poverty rates
high coverage
i want to make a map of all the areas
so that
they just color code all variations we
have that i know
where to go
can you make a map of all area types
can you make a map of the area types
okay
there's nothing called mini slice
okay
okay
um
can you make a map filtered by southwest
plus urban plus very high coveted risk
index
okay
so it does do the filtering
you know it's the funniest thing
it's literally saying the all the same
thing
just so it
makes it
oh
[Music]
stop that's cool
you wanted to just delete them
they look cool
they look cool but they're useless
wait
line of cases versus color oh wait a
minute
i like this one
see
this is the same thing
oh that's my region
they all started in
november and december
you can really see the high correlation
of people just not caring in 2020
by the end of it
i think there's a correlation
can you make a line chart of cases
versus
date colored by area type and region
let's go can you not combine them
can you make a line chart of cases
versus date colored by area type plus a
region
thank you for talking to a human you're
excited
oh can you make a line chart of cases
versus date colored by area type and the
region
yes sir
this is going to give us the same thing
yes sir
seems like that's his go-to
it's always access to doctors
um
city
but obviously makes sense that there's a
lot of cases in small cities but also
wanna test like small things can you
select rule
i think so yes
oh let me try this can you remove rural
from this map
can you remove bourbon from this map
did you remove the pacific from this map
okay
can you remove
non-contiguous from this chart
yeah because we don't need that what if
we want to remove stuff
[Music]
i know it'll be nice
can you remove the rockies from this
chart
can you remove the rockies from this
chart
arnie what can you do
does it seem
for the meantime it just seems like he
can only make charts
which i guess is fine for now
uh
okay let's let's start looking at
question one which regions of the uh
should we prioritize without working
resources
you can see
clearly
if we're talking about
like
area type density
seems to be the midwest
and the southeast
but i want to make the chart so that we
can specifically point out
which areas of the map we are just in
case
no
should we make a map of regions
can you make a map
by region
can you make a map by region
i swear i was working earlier
let me delete it don't worry
i don't think it's worth it it's not
worth it okay
sure
that's a lot of scrolling back that's
why
is it going forever
it's not that forever but that's a lot
of them scrolling back for them
can you make a histogram of region
filtered by poverty
that's just a can you make a histogram
of region versus poverty
can you make a histogram of region and
poverty
baby
don't understand i don't understand how
this was made
can you make a bar graph of region
filtered by
very high poverty
can you make a map of regions filtered
by very high poverty
because it'll be really nice if you can
get
just the map of the cleaners versus
can you make a chart of poverty versus
covers
that's good
meantime
all we have um for
um you guys like to try to summarize
the charts that you created
so basically
for the questions that
you're trying to answer you know the
question try to explain what the answer
is to the question by
pointing out the charts that
try like you're trying to explain it to
somebody
i believe that the answer is this
because this chart seemed like this
well so
for question one which regions of the us
should we prioritize for directing
resources
it seems like uh just based off of the
first two initial maps that we were
making map of poverty and map of coveted
risks we can see a heavy correlation
between the two color-coded more in the
south west or the southeast i mean
and uh just the southern countries in
general
um we were trying to mess around with uh
by area types
sorry we're trying to look through uh
the map of covaris as well as the map of
poverty and just by looking at the
the heat the heat maps that we see from
this uh
there's a heavy correlation in the
southeast
and mostly the southern countries that
we would say has a very high risk and
something we should prioritize with
direct resources
uh in addition to that we noticed that
sorry oh yes
in addition to that we see with uh the
heat map charts of covered risk versus
access to doctors
uh
there's a
very high risk index
that also
correlates to very
low access to doctors
and
with a map that we had earlier
it showed that most of the southeast uh
counties also had a very
low access rate to doctors
although it would have been nice if we
kept that um
this is the priority of the county type
keep something for 20 times
i mean we kept this
chart over here
let's see
for number two we uh we might have
deleted most of the charts in terms of
area types but just off of this one we
can see that uh
when prioritizing for uh resources
depending on area types we should
definitely be looking more into
the small cities which are
okay i don't know we should be looking
more into small cities
uh suburban areas as well as urban areas
which i think would be linked towards
uh
more heavily dense uh populations
given the area type
we can also see that
it also correlates to what we said with
the southeast having the most amount of
people
in in the urban areas and earlier we
also seen
that it's the highest amount in suburban
areas
although i think it's
further down the deleted line
um
so much
so for number three we're only able to
answer
uh letter g because like the limitations
we can only plot like one attribute for
a map
so the map of region versus access to
doctors we can see that they're very low
records for
these
pacific non-contiguous
rockies especially the northeast here
there's very low on counts for high
access to doctors so she we would
prioritize it here
and not so much in the midwest because
they have
high counts of taxes
seconds
for number four one of the interesting
things that we noticed when we were
doing these uh compound combinations of
parameters
is uh for example if we're bringing up a
map of the midwest rural plus very high
poverty rates it really does single them
down to very small um
uh highlighted areas that we can look
into which would be really nice for if
we're specifically looking for like a
city or a county that we should target
on
um although it's very finicky to as to
why we want to single down that hard for
the meantime
um
okay she's exploring the data type so
one of the ways to explore the data type
is to see where we could give more
doctors per like each region
so we created a histogram access dockers
filtered by southeast so this shows just
areas of the southeast
oh
very high access to dogs
so i guess they don't really need
all
more resources for this
yeah
it's kind of interesting to kind of mess
around with it
yeah most of the most of trying to make
the charts has been kind of dictated on
understanding the whole
um
like use of a party and it definitely um
there's a lot of uh more keywords that
could be added to kind of
help with the process i think
knowing what was the
of the word for filter would have been
really nice
but it seems like uh
he does give a lot of random charts just
by normally talking and they do be
helpful once in a while other times it
seems like he has a huge problem with
access to doctors always constantly
showing up yeah
but
overall it's been really nice i think uh
it's really cool that it he is filtered
by mostly what we want other times just
against volume
i want to ask him your question yeah
so have a seat uh grab the chairs and
just have a seat yes for sure
you want us to turn off um all right
jesus already off we shouldn't be off
right
and you can still face the face of the
wall
i still we're still recording so i want
to make sure the microphone is able to
pick up
yeah everything
especially rj you have to sit here
so they think they can hear you online
so
um
so you kind of already answered this but
i'm going to ask for again
um
for both of your responses
uh how was your experience with artie
what did you like
what did you not like
and was he helpful
i liked my experience with artie it was
kind of like talking to
like a mixture of a human and an api
so
we could just use normal speak to say oh
make a map of this and that
but sometimes when we wanted to make
like a very specific map
with specific filters sometimes it
wouldn't work
and it would give us different types of
information that we
didn't need but it's also good because
sometimes it would
um
like even if it gives us information we
don't need
um
we might still infer
um
some stuff like the soundtracks i mean
something
and then sometimes when we make it a
little bit too specific it gives us like
invalid checks like the little pixels
yeah for me like
i really like the idea of what already
is because it really does feel like
jarvis
in a sense where it is a
kind of a
mock ai assistant for this kind of stuff
there's a lot of things that i really
like it seems like a lot of the
very simple vocal recognizations
um are adhered to
although
definitely when it comes to more complex
stuff
uh with the filtering expect especially
it seems like it's a little finicky
uh one thing i do like though is
um
the filtering does seem to work if we're
working with different data types but if
we're working with like filtering on
like poverty and coping risk for
specific
um
i guess
data visualizations it's just simply not
working it seems like heat maps
does that but we can't do that with maps
or
i think line graphs
which is something that i think is
something
that it needs to pick up defects on it
also seems like he takes in a lot of um
like keywords but it is also lacking on
a lot of other major keywords that would
be helpful to um
for people to kind of
talk with to already especially filter i
think that's one of the words that needs
to be
like kind of working and
does he actually filter like maps if you
select that
yeah
but
um
the keywords are
it's looking at the colors
so the keywords are
supposed to be show
make
um
make these
make those can you make these into
a bar chart can you make this um
can you modify this chart
and put in another attribute or
something oh yes yes
yeah
so it has to be a
very specific language
does it take synonyms
like modifying and say change
uh no i don't think change is in there
okay
because if we're going to use this for
like a broader
audience they might have like different
ways of seeing things yeah like if
they're not ics majors they might have
just changed this
would would you
find him annoying if he had a lot of
keywords and he was reacting to
a lot of
everything you were saying
or would it be
i think it would be better as long as
you're making sure that like we deselect
maps and so that he's not like
accidentally removing or deleting things
yeah with a lot of keywords he'll be
really nice but it's just mostly
uh due to the nature of
how he was making a lot of charts
unnecessarily
um it might be just part of how we said
specific vernacular
or it might also just be um
just the nature of how reactive he is
but
i would like to see what it would be
like it already had way more key
ketones to kind of adhere to
uh
yeah for sure it would be really cool
um
so
do you know a time when party
spontaneously made a chart if you didn't
explicitly ask for
and were they helpful to this question
uh
i think about this earlier but he kept
making
like heat maps uh line graphs and
like other stuff specifically for access
to doctors i don't know if there was a
key term that we might have said that
constantly made them to do so but
um
yeah it wasn't helpful but there was
times where he started making line
charts uh for the cases
versus like area type and region which
did help to be
they were very useful to a certain
degree
and uh if we were able to make more
data sets that were like in tandem with
what he has given us randomly i think it
would be very useful
i think it just comes with the time
machine of
how useful these random data sets would
be
in like correlation to
what we could answer in the questions
how did you feel the same way
yeah the same way with a lot of access
to doctors
but i feel like if we just generally say
math like or chart of this and that
um it didn't give us like different
types of charts to give us the same
charts but with different attributes
sounds
so i guess that would be helpful if we
just wanted like
individual
separate filters
sorry i don't want to ask you guys the
same question
so i'm trying to
first
um
i think we could elaborate more on small
like things that we noticed oh yeah i
think one of the uh
one of the biggest uh like
sinkholes with uh arnie
is the fact that we have a map data set
and a heat map and sometimes when he uh
when we can't elaborate or i guess and
then see words well he seems to make
more maps than he which is a problem so
i don't know if there's a better way to
say heat map
or it's just um
keep map don't make a heat map or map
when they come out yeah if you mess up
on the word heat or if it doesn't hurt
um properly here heat
in there
it's gonna default to now yeah
yeah so it seems like they were getting
more maps and heat pumps oh when we
explicitly asked for events but uh yeah
that's that's one of the other things i
want to say one word two words
it's two words
okay so
okay
when you search for the key term
the search has two words
or one word
um
i do uh
i just actually has one word
keep my participation into that oh
surely
what limitation did you see with artie
um is there anything that you wanted him
to do more but
couldn't like
is there any commands that you assume
that he wouldn't do
i think what you wanted them to do
i think it was the same issue of us
trying to modify one shrine
like where the keywords were
specifically modified instead of change
um
like we wanted to remove null values so
they wouldn't be in the chart or maybe
like flip x and y axis
on heat maps
but making choices
i just didn't
know like these are um keywords for
specific charts
yeah for sure for sure
and um it goes back to the
like
the data types as well um
for specific data sets he just doesn't
like to make a comparison especially
with math it doesn't it doesn't seem
like it filters the same data type for
like poverty
code risk
uh access to doctors versus each other
meanwhile the heat maps and histograms
seem to do so
uh maybe it's the way we just worded
things but uh
we kind of expected that already was
able to make a map to compare
those kind of data types for the map
just that data set
i sort of wish that artie would have
different messages for errors than we
had
like if we kept repeating the same map
perhaps you would say like oh there's
already math created or if we can't
create a map for two different data sets
maybe you would say oh i can't map
between
this and that
so that we would know not to see those
okay so here's another question so when
you guys are making visualizations um
did you already
have
what it might look like in your mind or
were you just expecting party to
somehow put all of these together
i was um i guess what
already for me at the very least
i wanted like
i had my sort of expectations going into
it so
um
i have
specific ways on my mind like wanting
perhaps coleman risk based off of region
i was one thing to kind of like
that we wanted to see maybe like it
would highlight different colors
uh but um
uh
i didn't expect
artie to like combine
maps together like ones that we created
and then just mash them together
uh i i just expected that you get a map
then you can modify it to what you want
afterwards
for the very
um
i thought already would have
higher capabilities of making multiple
bar charts like for example i wanted to
make one for
like all the diseases and diabetes
cardiovascular
into the bar charts and have them by
region
so all those attributes into one program
but i guess they're just naked
separately
um
that could be an added feature
i'm sorry um
so when you guys were expecting
two attributes in a map
what did you expect that to look like
because i noticed you guys are saying
um i think you guys are trying to
combine those two yeah
i guess if we were to kind of
single it down
it would be like places that correlate
with
like places that had very high poverty
and also very high risk maybe that's
what we were like in my mind that's what
i was trying to
visualize like we want places that have
similarly high
areas of
okay so or even even more so like a
place with very high poverty rate but
also have a very low access to doctors
i i guess it's redundant but it also um
allows to
reinforce
uh
like
a thought of what the correlation might
be yeah i know i know yeah yeah
because it seems like you can definitely
do that with
with the histograms yeah where like we
can access the doctor's filter by a
specific place that also has a very high
poverty rate so that's what i was like
thinking was possible a possibility for
the maps as well
yeah
um
you have two more questions
so how was your experience working with
a partner to explore the data set
because usually these are done
you know individually on company for one
person how did they feel like having a
partner there
it was good that we can expand on each
other's ideas
to create more ideas
and
it just helped making like experimenting
your party very fast so you can like
churn out more charts at a time
i think it's also good because uh
different mindsets also means different
approaches to
uh the questions that we wanted to get
answered so
um
while she might have her own idea of
like
what information would solve this
question i can also use that to maybe uh
mix with my own uh approach to it and it
it does allow for
i guess even better answers than what i
would
think beforehand stuff like that okay
so do you think you would have came to
the same conclusion you're on your own
or
um
i'm not too sure
maybe not on my own because when i like
to
think through problems i like to think
i'm silent
so it's very good to voice out
my
thoughts with another partner and
doing so ill help trigger party to
create one match
i think with like
working with a partner it there is a
more slower methodical way of handling
it since now you have to hear uh the
opinions of another person as well
but
um
i
i wouldn't say that i would uh
get to the these answers the same way
because i would probably be uh in my
brain i would probably put lower
priority uh data types like to the side
because
uh you already assumed that you wouldn't
care for them until you actually look at
them whatever
something uninsured and it was like
not accessible
there's just a few data types that it
seemed like were useless unless you had
somebody to tell you to look into them
which is what
happened okay
so were you more confident in your
answer at the end when you had
someone
yeah let's do something okay
anything
you want
so did you learn something
about copenhagen
from looking at these charts that maybe
you didn't realize or
oh for sure
i guess well
maybe it it it kind of
more
facilitates my mentality from like
knowing the news and whatnot but yeah
definitely like
the midwest
southeast
definite places of haikovich
like florida crazy amounts and like
i guess looking into this kind of
uh just cemented a lot of my
preconceived notions of
uh how kobe was spreading and where it
is very densely populated but it's also
interesting to see newer things like oh
yeah these places also have very low
access to doctors or very high poverty
which is very surprising
and maybe that is partially the reason
why
um
so
you notice that we don't show you what
already
thinks you're saying
or if you don't see
your what you're saying to it you're
scrolling across the screen
would you like to be able to see it
um
um maybe since
um some people might have trouble uh
they might have trouble recognizing your
voice right they have problems
enunciating your words
it would be great if they could if we
could arrange a party could see by
dictating things
for people who can't speak well with you
right
i think uh
it'll be nice if it's more like
uh
if it's one of those things where it's
like oh do you mean heat math
and then you say yes or no and then
maybe it would
uh then complete your query right that
would that would be really interesting
because i i feel like google translate
and some other stuff does that where
it's just like oh what do you mean
instead of what you probably said yeah
all right
do you use siri or or um
alexa or google
yeah when i'm at home i use electrical
nest oh
no
all right
so do you do you both have this at home
or something like that or do you use it
are you at home yeah which one
uh alexa
yeah
no no alexa stop stop
uh i use
bixby for my samsung phone and i use
things to just
make alarms set alarms and
i mean i tried to play variety music
last night with alexa it wasn't really
working
but that's just part of it
okay
all right well that's been that's been
really helpful
um
very
that's good that's good this is actually
very helpful because you know
i mean like
when you're making a product you really
hope for the best of it but sometimes
you gotta know that there's gonna be a
lot of people yeah it helps us
anticipate what are the other commands
that people might say that we can think
of
it allows us to see when
an artist is misunderstanding what are
better ways for them to respond or sleep
a little more natural yeah
like we didn't you used to have arnie
saying nice to meet you
but
we thought we'd just put it in just for
the beginning part
and just to encourage you to think of it
as a person
but it kind of backfires because
they kept saying
because it looks very very high like you
guys are saying high culvert risk so it
just seems oh that makes sense
and then we noticed that you guys were
talking to each other really quietly
right tonight set off
yeah and so
but we were thinking how can we
set it up so that
you didn't
try to speak so quietly because
partying by listening to you
in theory should be able to
help you make the query more precise
when you are being paid as richard so
and so
i think you know so maybe in future
experiments
we may have to
somehow separate people
so they are forced to talk aloud
you know or that's not natural and you
know i mean certainly presumably would
work because to resume everyone has to
talk right
yeah in this case
you were kind of treating
already
differently right and you wouldn't treat
a human that way yeah right so
what can we do to
have you treat already
maybe are you just
disoffended if you don't include it in
the conversation
yeah
you have a police class to be like hey
i'm here or something like that yeah
also the fact that rd doesn't actually
say anything
audibly
does that tend to make you kind of
ignore it more
since he's kind of in the corner
yeah and the only time you talk to him
is when it replies with the butt
okay maybe you could be like on the top
middle
so you can both see it
why would it be weird if the hovers by
people like perpetually
i don't know i mean
or maybe you would be life-sized
standing in the corner oh
that'd be
intimidating because that's what a
normal human would be right
i guess it really is this like this
aspect of like jarvis in this with the
hearty
and uh finding the human qualities
so the question is should we even have a
picture of him or should it be just like
jarvis we you know you don't see jarvis
you just hear jarvis
i mean
i guess a like visualization of like
speaking would be cool
maybe perhaps but uh
um
yeah maybe just ways to have people know
that he's there more prominent than what
he knows
although making like vocal
like
cues and stuff might be a bit
too much
yeah because alexa like probably took me
years to make
to like get to the point where it's just
like here are things or like
just say shadow words and all that right
yeah
it's still very cool though did you
notice like he was actively listening to
it
yes so
uh it seems like the one way you know
that he is trying to complete a query
whether you know
whether it's working or not would you
just flash like
a 404 png image
like if you're talking because i think i
noticed that it's like a gift cycle and
at the very end has this 404 png but
another thing that you notice is if he
can't complete the query and he is
listening to you
it would just flash it like real fast
and we're like oh you didn't listen okay
next next question or next thing to say
yeah you may have to scale down the
png's
they're really great
so that's why it takes longer to load
how much did you look at artie
um
i looked at him when the charts were
being made okay that's the only time oh
no i was looking at him the whole time
if i'm saying something yeah
but only when you talk to him right um i
also uh i also noticed that when he's
making a lot of stuff he would i would
look at him to see how he's reacting it
seems like yeah there's just very
there's a lot of key words where he'll
just start making stuff without you
asking
and it was like
i'll be like
i wonder if i can use coven wrist versus
suburban and it would make something
like that although it's not 100
what i wanted or i guess what i was
wondering it's still nice that he kind
of just throws in things that are
vaguely
relating to it
although i don't know if that's just
part of just the vocal
of
of his nature in general
it's still cola yeah yeah
yeah we have it built in where
it will it will spontaneously make a
visualization that you don't ask for
but it's been listening all this time
and trying to figure out maybe this
might be helpful
and we're just trying to figure out is
it wrong most of the time or is it right
or is it annoying
well as you can see there's a point
where we asked for multiple histograms
and it just gave us regions
but
uh i think there was this one point
where we said line chart like 15 minutes
ago and then i don't know where it
started making line charts for us so
that's really cool
that
um
um i definitely don't right yeah
yeah
yeah thank you it was
really helpful well thank you it was
really cool we'd like to invite you back
but we can't because in theory you're
tainted
so but if you know of other people
who could be good
test subjects
especially if they're like you know
non-computer scientists scientist
yeah like for example like they are they
work they work and they work in like
with their nurses or their
health health care types or sociologist
types
what if they're acl and they really
because you know computer science teams
tend to have a certain way of talking to
computers and then
non-computer scientists have a different
way of talking to computers that's very
true i'm pretty sure because of computer
science we're mostly talking about like
yourself you're looking at the png
errors
actually i do have a question you said
that you only looked at are you when uh
when you was drawing the charts yeah why
were you looking at it in those times
um because i wanted to see if my
keywords are being like activated like
when i specifically said like make a
chart of this investment
i wanted to
we were looking for that blob that says
making
like three charts yeah making three
charts or i can't make charts for them
yeah for me i was mostly looking at um
uh the way already kind of reacted to
ways you can speak just so that like
in the beginning it was mostly so that i
can see if uh something counts as a
successful query or if it's not a
successful query um definitely with the
flashing png
but that was like the one main cue for
me to be like okay that's how i know
it's a successful query or not and then
i just kind of use that whenever i was
talking to already to make more charts
yeah
but every time yeah i would look at him
just so to make sure that if we are
making something
um
he did recognize us
because other times like we would repeat
something maybe two or three times and
then maybe the third time it would
actually
work to what we wanted
so arjuna can you switch over to the to
the
diagnostics
so that we can have a recording of that
from the video too
whoa
so these are all the attributes that
you've said
over time
and that all the text there is a text
transcript
yeah there's a lot of synonyms that the
library is using that makes access to
doctors
[Music]
frequency count negative
so what does the negative frequency
counts like
[Music]
[Music]
to say something like you know i don't
think this has
to be fair i don't know how
here i can recognize his access to
doctors because i'm pretty sure we only
said it maybe ten times i think
um
nate
is somehow a synonym
i might have to just remove that
i didn't know that was a synonym
[Music]
capturing your little conversations in
between
remove the no value i don't know yeah
that's definitely one thing you need to
say yeah it's it's just
no i guess this is everything okay good
see like it misunderstood certain words
right
he really loves giving this afternoon
but you see we didn't want to show you
everything it said because then it's
going to start distracting you with what
do you mean by mickey mouse
and that's what alexa's doing most of
the time too
olivia for sure and then it's just
making a
lucky guess to see well let's say
something general in response to cp
accept that
like i really like the versus code with
culver address traxxas pump metal
yeah pro fitness and hopping
i guess the
consideration of like showing everything
what he said wouldn't it be good for
ferdi since he's listening to the petrol
okay nobody even said ella can you flip
the x and y axis so you just listen
so what do you mean by flip the x on my
axis because then that that was just
more cosmetic oh wait for the sheet mask
show battle bots baseball tournament
some beautiful things that we had
somehow
i think it's google thinking that
oh a lot of people say battlebots
baseball tournament
maybe it just like smashes
that's the best one right there so let's
save this rj so we don't use it yeah
we'll definitely look into the game
because that's
vulnerability
all right
well thanks a lot
don't want to hold you too too much
longer don't have lunch
and i'll
probably send you the amazon gift card
tonight
oh for sure yeah
yeah so
the real question is where's
clyde where's claude here today i'm here
today
hope you wondered that i should have let
me know oh my god
that would have been a very nice
addition to this
you guys did great thank you
yeah there was at one part i was like
yeah it was right yeah i thought it was
real
like
