gonna record both huh okay let's see
what happens
it blows up
okay so let's restart this app
really
so everything
is hands-on
okay so everything should be recording
now right yes
okay so
i might want this a little bit more
okay maybe not
oh
okay
all right so i might so what was the
query again
so i need something useful
oh i didn't say anything

so
which regions
of the u.s we prioritize for directing
resources
show me the regions of the united states
show me a map of regions

it surprises you even
so it looks like
southeast
south east
that's
this area and the midwest
are the highest
so there's a lot of counties
there's a lot of
little sleeves
well i could kill my paper yeah because
it's an infrared screen
that's why it picks it up and then
our region's different the regions are
different
show me covet in the southeast
very high
yeah so
it's selected
when you're dragging it
that means
when you click it it's you're selected
and that means you're getting ready to
do a pivot oh but when you're dragging
it it also makes sense
you have to make sure you have selected
oh
so

axes are not the same
so we may
want to figure a way to
okay
so this is selected so okay
show me the same map for
the east coast

percentage and covet risk
it's like black magic
it says voodoo
access to doctors
by region huh
okay let's stop this for now
let's save all your data
i'll save your app data too
yeah
good because when we saved your app data
the software captured made a screenshot
of this whole thing too
oh that's right right
because we don't make one you don't make
one right yeah
so this is this is nice to see
right
and then
so now let's stop this guy
